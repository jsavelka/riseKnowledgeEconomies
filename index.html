    <p>The figure shows the main visualization with the ranking time paths for the United States and Canada highlighted in green and for Japan and the Korea Republic in blue. This particular setup allows one to see that while the two high-tech West Asia countries are holding to their top ranks throughout the period of interest the two North America countries are losing their top ranks.</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Ranking time paths: Rise of the knowledge-based economies is an interactive visualization about how much effort individual countries put in becoming knowledge-based economies during the period between 1998 and 2012. The visualization uses data about government expenditure per student in primary education (% of GDP per capita), research and development expenditure (% of GDP), and percentage of internet users obtained from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank data center</a>. It presents the data in an intuitive and easy to understand way by using the ranking time paths. Therefore, the visualization has almost no requirements with respect to the knowledge of the user. Anyone can easily see which countries, given their circumstances, are putting considerable effort into becoming knowledge-based economies and which countries are not. Despite the use of historical data the visualization offers a unique insight into where each countries see themselves in the future.</p>
